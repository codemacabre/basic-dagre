# Basic Dagre

A basic example of how to write a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using [dagre-d3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dagre-d3).

This is a companion to my guide, [DAGs in D3](https://codemacabre.com/notes/dags-in-d3).

### Usage
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the example
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
